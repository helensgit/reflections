How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	The bug often hide in the change of new file when the old file is fine.
	So, we can use diff/FC command to find the bug quickly without viewing by ourself.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	As a programmer, we often need to view difference between old version
	and new version files, and compare these files to find the bugs.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	pros:We know all the details about the history of the file.
	cons:Too many commands are tiring.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	Using the command git log, I can find the history.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

	Having version control, I can go back to the right version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	To test some command.
